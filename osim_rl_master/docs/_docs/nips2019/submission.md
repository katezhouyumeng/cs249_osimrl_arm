Submitting solutions may not be straighforward for those not familiar with building docker images.
Therefore, we recommend participants to master the submission process earlier during the competition by following the description [here](https://github.com/AIcrowd/neurips2019-learning-to-move-starter-kit).

Note that the evaluation environment of Round 1 is set as `model='3D'`, `difficulty=2`, `project=True`, and `obs_as_dict=True`.

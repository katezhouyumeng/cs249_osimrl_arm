We provide a controller adapted from [Song and Geyer, 2015](https://physoc-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/full/10.1113/JP270228).
The controller consists of physiologically plausible reflex circuits and shows that a fairly simple network can generate diverse locomotion behaviors.
In addition, one can use the model for imitation learning or for training a hierarchical control network.
An example code *./examples/sim_L2M2019_controller.py* runs the controller for a 2D human model.


If you use the controller in your research, you can cite it as follows:

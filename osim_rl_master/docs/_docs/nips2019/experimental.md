title: Experimental data

You can use experimental data to bootstrap the algorithm.
Example running and walking kinematics can be found in many publicly available papers.
Here, we provide some example data.

[Joint angles](https://s3.amazonaws.com/osim-rl/data/schwartz2008data/joint_angles.txt) and [EMG signals](https://s3.amazonaws.com/osim-rl/data/schwartz2008data/emg.txt) for very slow, slow, free, fast, and very fast walking from:

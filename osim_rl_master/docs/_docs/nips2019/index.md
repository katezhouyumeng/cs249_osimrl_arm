This repository contains software required for participation in the NeurIPS 2019 Challenge: Learn to Move - Walk Around. In this competition, your task is to develop a controller for a physiologically plausible 3D human model to move (walk or run) following velocity commands with minimum effort. Find out more about the challenge [**here**](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2019-learning-to-move-walk-around).
